# 🤝 Greeting Flow

import { Conversation, User, Assistant } from "../../src/components/convengine";

## Scenario

A simple greeting interaction is handled entirely without schema extraction.

<Conversation
  engineStatus="RUNNING"
  engineDetails={
    <>
      <div className="ce-engine-item success">intent = GREETING</div>
      <div className="ce-engine-item ok">matched greeting classifier</div>
    </>
  }
>
  <User>Hi</User>

  <Assistant>
    Hi, I am Conv Assistant 👋  
    How can I help you today?
  </Assistant>
</Conversation>

## What Happened Internally
