# Developer Guide (v2)

## Build order for a new flow

1. define intent/state and response rows
2. define schema row (if slot collection needed)
3. define rule transitions by phase
4. define pending actions in `ce_pending_action` for confirmation flows
5. configure `convengine.flow.*`
6. add tool rows and adapters if external execution is needed
7. replay test with expected intent/state assertions

## `convengine.flow.*` checklist

- `dialogue-act.*`
- `interaction-policy.*`
- `action-lifecycle.*`
- `disambiguation.*`
- `guardrail.*`
- `state-graph.*`
- `tool-orchestration.*`
- `memory.*`

## Extension points

- `CeTask` / `CeTaskExecutor`
- `McpToolExecutor` and adapter interfaces
- `ConversationMemoryStore`
- `EngineStepHook`
- custom rule type/action resolvers

## Operational safety checklist

- configure fallback response rows for `UNKNOWN`/`ANY`
- do not depend on one rule only; use phase-specific rules
- verify pending-action catalog priorities to avoid ambiguous execution
- enable state-graph validation before promoting to production
- monitor audit for guardrail and disambiguation stages

## Regression strategy

Use `ConversationReplayService` to replay scripted turns and assert expected intent/state at each turn.
