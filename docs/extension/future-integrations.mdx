# 🔮 Future Integrations

ConvEngine is intentionally designed as a **core decision and orchestration layer**.
Everything beyond this layer can evolve independently.

This page outlines **planned and natural extensions** that fit cleanly into the existing architecture.

---

## 🧠 Workflow Engines (Temporal / Durable Tasks)

ConvEngine can act as the **decision brain** in front of a workflow engine.

### How it fits
- ConvEngine handles:
  - intent detection
  - validation
  - schema completeness
  - confirmations
- Workflow engine handles:
  - execution
  - retries
  - long‑running state
  - compensation

### Example
- User confirms an ACTION intent
- Engine reaches `state = READY`
- ConvEngine emits an execution event
- Temporal workflow starts with structured payload

> ConvEngine decides **what should happen**  
> Workflow decides **how it happens**

---

## 🖥️ UI Platforms

ConvEngine is UI‑agnostic by design.

### Supported / Planned
- Web (React, Angular, Vue)
- Mobile (React Native, Swift, Kotlin)
- Chat platforms (Slack, Teams, WhatsApp)
- Voice assistants

UI consumes **structured UI JSON** from `ce_response`
and renders components dynamically.

## 🤖 Multiple LLM Providers

The LLM layer already supports pluggability.

### Planned providers
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- Anthropic
- Local models (Ollama, LM Studio)

Each provider:
- Implements `LlmClient`
- Logs calls via `ce_llm_call_log`
- Uses the same prompt templates

---

## 🔍 Advanced Observability

Beyond basic logging:

- Prompt diffing
- Schema drift detection
- Token usage analytics
- Latency dashboards
- Conversation replay UI

All powered from existing audit + LLM logs.

---

## 🧩 Plugins & Extensions

Future extensions may include:
- Custom rule evaluators
- External policy engines
- ML‑based intent classifiers
- Domain‑specific schema libraries

ConvEngine remains small.
Capabilities grow through **plugins**, not core bloat.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Compliance

Planned additions:
- PII masking before LLM calls
- Field‑level encryption in `context_json`
- Role‑based conversation policies
- Audit exports for compliance

---

## 🧭 Final Thought

ConvEngine is not a chatbot framework.

It is a **decision engine** that speaks conversationally.

Everything else — workflows, UI, AI providers — can evolve around it.
