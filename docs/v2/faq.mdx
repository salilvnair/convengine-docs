# FAQ

## Is v1 still available?

Yes. v1 docs are still available from the version dropdown.

## How does the engine understand "yes/ok/do that"?

Using `DialogueActStep` + `InteractionPolicyStep` + pending-action context, not only intent keyword matching.

## Does `StateGraphStep` mutate state?

No. The current implementation is validate-only; it audits validity and can set a soft-block flag.

## Can I configure behavior without Java changes?

Yes. Primary control should be through:

- `ce_rule`
- `ce_response`
- `ce_pending_action`
- `ce_policy`
- `convengine.flow.*`

## How do we avoid 500s for conversational mismatches?

- keep fallback `UNKNOWN`/`ANY` rows
- use disambiguation and guardrail paths
- ensure response mappings exist for reachable states
