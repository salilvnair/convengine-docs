# ConvEngine

ConvEngine is a **schema-driven conversational engine** designed for
**structured, stateful, and auditable conversations**.

It is **not a chatbot**.

ConvEngine combines the following building blocks:

- Finite State Machines (FSM)
- Database-driven intent classification and rules
- JSON Schema–based structured extraction
- Large Language Models (LLMs) used as **assistive tools**, not decision makers

The goal of ConvEngine is to provide a **generic, extensible framework**
that can power conversational workflows across domains such as:

- Service migration (Zapper use case)
- Resume building (iResume)
- Banking and onboarding flows
- Enterprise workflow orchestration

This documentation explains:

- How ConvEngine is architected
- How conversations flow internally
- How database schemas drive behavior
- How LLMs are safely integrated
- How to extend the framework without changing core code
