# Consumer Integration

## What changed in integration

- Configure behavior via `convengine.flow.*`
- Use `ce_pending_action` for confirmable actions
- Prefer rules/policy over custom Java branching
- Add tool executors through tool-group adapters

## Minimum setup

- `@EnableConvEngine`
- `LlmClient` implementation
- DDL + seed for required `ce_*` tables
- response/rule rows for initial and terminal states
