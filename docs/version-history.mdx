## Release Notes By Version

### 1.0.8 (Current in `pom.xml`)

Commits:
- `a2daeec` core release bump and transport/audit foundation
- `57a2faa` async audit dispatch + deferred flush controls (post-bump enhancements on same line)
- `c5c665f` typed step API via <MethodRef>EngineStep.Name</MethodRef>
- `0c2c557` rule action rename to <MethodRef>GET_SCHEMA_JSON</MethodRef>

What changed in detail:
- Added streaming transport stack:
  - SSE and STOMP/WebSocket support
  - consumer-configurable stream mode
- Added audit event plumbing:
  - `AuditEventListener` extension point
  - stage broadcast path for streaming UIs
- Added advanced audit controls:
  - async dispatch workers
  - queue/backpressure policy
  - deferred bulk persistence + flush triggers
- Strengthened step extension API:
  - string-based step matching replaced by typed <MethodRef>EngineStep.Name</MethodRef>
  - safer `EngineStepHook` contracts (`supports/beforeStep/afterStep/onStepError`)
- Renamed schema action contract:
  - `GET_SCHEMA_EXTRACTED_DATA` -> `GET_SCHEMA_JSON`
  - aligned resolver/session access semantics
