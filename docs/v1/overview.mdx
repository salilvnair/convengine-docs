# ConvEngine Overview (v1)

ConvEngine is a deterministic, DB-configured conversation engine. It is built for workflow-grade systems where behavior must be auditable and configurable through data.

Refer to v2 docs for:

- dialogue act and interaction policy v2
- pending action lifecycle/disambiguation/guardrail
- tool orchestration and post-tool rule phase
- state graph validate mode
- memory and replay/eval additions
