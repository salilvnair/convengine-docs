# Examples (v2)

## 1. Mapper Studio publish/confirm flow

Turn sequence:

1. Agent asks finalize confirmation.
2. User sends `confirm` / `publish` / `generate excel` / `download excel`.
3. `DialogueActStep` => `AFFIRM`.
4. `InteractionPolicyStep` => `EXECUTE_PENDING_ACTION`.
5. `PendingActionStep` executes mapped `ce_pending_action` task.
6. Rules move state (for example `PUBLISHED`).
7. Response resolver returns publish confirmation payload.

## 2. Ambiguous action disambiguation

If multiple actions are eligible with equal top priority:

- `DisambiguationStep` sets clarification question
- execution is paused safely
- no accidental action execution

## 3. Guarded sensitive action

If sensitive pattern matched and approval is required but missing:

- `GuardrailStep` denies
- tool and pending-action execution are skipped
- flow continues to safe response path with audit visibility

## 4. Tool orchestration flow

When input includes `tool_request`:

- `ToolOrchestrationStep` dispatches by `tool_group`
- writes `tool_result` and `tool_status`
- executes `TOOL_POST_EXECUTION` rules

## 5. Zapper move-connection flow

1. User: move connection city1 to city2.
2. Schema extraction identifies missing `custId`, `phone`, `email`.
3. Engine asks follow-up for missing fields.
4. User provides values.
5. Engine asks confirmation.
6. User: `ok` / `yes please` / `go ahead`.
7. Policy resolves against pending action and executes move request task.
