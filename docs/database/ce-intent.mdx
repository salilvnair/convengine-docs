# 🎯  Intent Registry

In ConvEngine, an **Intent** represents the **semantic goal** of the user —  
_not how they said it, but what they want to achieve_.

---

## 🧠 What an Intent Is

An **intent** answers this question:

> “What is the user fundamentally trying to do?”

Examples:
- `GREETING` → small talk / conversation start
- `ACTION` → perform a structured operation
- `UNKNOWN` → fallback when meaning is unclear

<Highlight type="success">
Intent is a **stable contract** used by rules, schemas, and responses.
</Highlight>

## 🚫 What an Intent Is NOT

<Highlight type="danger">
An intent is **NOT**:
</Highlight>

- ❌ Raw NLP classification
- ❌ A regex match
- ❌ A state in the flow
- ❌ A UI action
- ❌ Something the LLM is allowed to invent

Intent is **deterministic and controlled by the engine**.

## 🗂 Table Definition

```sql
CREATE TABLE ce_intent (
  intent_code   TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  description   TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority      INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,
  enabled       BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  created_at    TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

---

## 🧪 Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO ce_intent (intent_code, description, priority, enabled)
VALUES
  ('GREETING', 'Greeting / small talk', 10, true),
  ('ACTION',   'Structured business action', 20, true),
  ('UNKNOWN',  'Fallback intent', 999, true);
```

---

## ✅ Summary

- `ce_intent` defines **what users can do**
- It is **engine-owned**, not LLM-owned
- It drives schemas, responses, and workflows
